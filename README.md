# Budgeter-App

**Problem:**

Budgeting is the process of creating a plan to spend your money. This spending plan is called a budget. Creating this spending plan allows you to determine in advance whether you will have enough money to do the things you need to do or would like to do. Due to a lot of chores during the day, people usually forget about their daily transactions. It becomes necessary for them to keep a record of all the transactions they have made during the month including the bills, loans etc. Also, it is needed to keep a check on the amount saved to consider buying new things or while giving a loan to someone. If you don't have enough money to do everything you would like to do, then you can use our application (Hisaab Kitaab) for planning process to prioritize your spending and focus your money on the things that are most important to you.
